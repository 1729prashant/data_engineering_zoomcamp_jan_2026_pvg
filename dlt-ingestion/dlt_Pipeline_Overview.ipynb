    "→ Fetch real data from an API  \n",
    "→ Turn it into clean relational tables  \n",
    "→ Load it into a database  \n",
    "→ Explore and analyze it  \n",

    "We will use the **Open Library API** as our data source and **DuckDB** as our database.\n",

    "- What a dlt source is  \n",
    "- What a dlt pipeline does  \n",
    "- How data moves through Extract → Normalize → Load  \n",
